# Lexical_Analysis (C++)

> Specify the code you want to analyze in “input.txt” file. (The file should be in the same directory as that of the cpp file or specify the location of file in the code.) The grammar follwed by this analyzer is : you have to give a blank to differentiate between two different entities, for eg : instead of writing "int c=a+b;", write it as "int c = a + b ;". 

> Open the cpp file, run it and in the output window it would show that a file named “output.txt” has been created in the same directory as that of the code.
 
> The output file contains the code broken into tokens.
